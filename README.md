# Visually-Impaired
Guide the visually impaired people in their surroundings.
We are aiming to develop smart cap, shoe and a belt which will help the blind people to walk without getting hurt by something or someone.
The smart cap has 3 ultrasonic(HC SR04) sensors attached to it one for the front and the other two for left and right. This will aware the persons of the obstacles in these three directions.
The smart will have one HC SR04 belt will prevent him from waist level obstacles.
